The Password Security Lab is designed to teach you about password security, cracking techniques, and the tools used in the industry. You'll gain hands-on experience with real-world scenarios and learn how passwords can be compromised. This will help you understand the importance of strong passwords and secure authentication methods.

### Learning Objectives

- Run programs in a bash command line environment
- Understand password security concepts and best practices
- Use John the Ripper to crack password hashes
- Analyze and interpret the results of password cracking attempts

### Lab Activities
